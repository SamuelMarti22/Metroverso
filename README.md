# Metroverso

"The Metro system is the main public transportation network in the city of Medellín. However, many of its users face difficulties in moving efficiently, especially when they are far from the system’s main lines. This situation is largely due to a lack of knowledge about the routes, stations, and complementary services such as feeder buses, integrated buses, and trams, which leads to delays, frustration, and obstacles in reaching their destinations.

In order to improve mobility and the user experience, this project proposes the development of a web application that, based on the user's location, identifies the nearest stations and builds an optimal route to help them reach their destination using the different components of the Metro system."
